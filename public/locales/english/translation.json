    "content": [
      {
        "question": "Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?",
        "answer": "Airborne spread has not been reported for COVID-19 and it is not believed to be a major driver of transmission based on available evidence. The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose. To protect yourself, clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?",
        "answer": "Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is most often spread from person to person. COVID-19 may be spread by people who are not showing symptoms. A person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it."
      },
      {
        "question": "Who is at risk of developing severe illness?",
        "answer": "While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people, older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes)  appear to develop serious illness more often than others. "
      },
      {
        "question": "Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19?",
        "answer": "Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019. However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care.\nPossible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under investigation. They are being tested through clinical trials. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat COVID-19."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long is the incubation period for COVID-19?",
        "answer": "The “incubation period” means the time between catching the virus and beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly around five days. These estimates will be updated as more data become available."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does the virus survive on surfaces?",
        "answer": "It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses.\nIf you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. Clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will I die if I get the Virus?",
        "answer": "COVID 19 is not a death sentence. People with COVID-19 generally develop signs and symptoms, including mild respiratory symptoms and fever, on an average of 5-6 days after infection (mean incubation period 5-6 days, range 1-14 days). Most people infected with COVID-19 virus have mild disease and recover."
      },
      {
        "question": "How can I help the fight against Coronavirus Pandemic?",
        "answer": "Report suspected cases as soon as possible. If you think you’re recently been in countries with cases of coronavirus outbreak or someone who have been contact with a confirmed cand having symptoms like High fever, sore throat, dry cough or difficulties in breathing . It’s advisable you take a test"
      },
      {
        "question": "When will this Outbreak end?",
        "answer": "No one has a specific date yet but the good news is that the world is united at this time to find a way to find a lasting solution to this pandemic as soon as possible."
